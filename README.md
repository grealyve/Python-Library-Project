## Introduction
Hi all, this is a librarian application. A menu pops up when you run the **.py** file. You can list all books in the **books.txt**, add a new book or search a book etc.
Here is the menu:

2- List checked out books.    
3- Add a new book.
4- Search book by ISBN number.
5- Search a book by name.     
6- Checking out a book.
7- List all students.
8- List top 3 books.
9- List top 3 students.
10- Exit.
```

## Install and Run
It's quite easy to use this application. All you have to do is:

```Python
python Library.py
```
and you'll encounter a menu.
